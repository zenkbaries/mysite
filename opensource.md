# Open Source

Web's principles of openness are fundamental to me. It has allowed me to be who I am today. Without it, I would be a different person. Also, it eliminated most of the obstacle I face as a Deaf person. 

Earlier in my life when I first experienced the World Wide Web. That experience was exhilarating and made me want to explore more. Also, at the same time, I was already dabbling in coding and experimenting with America Online. The openness of WWW has allowed me to expand my skills in computer and also allowed me to expand my knowledge of the world. (Wikipedia comes to mind for instance). 

I owe all this to the Internet's open and free nature. I recall while I was exploring and seeking more info to learn programming and web technologies, I encountered a roadblock. That roadblock is "proprietary" and "financial requirement." There are some technologies that I have to pay to use, to learn, and to expand. A most disabled person is at a disadvantage financially; therefore, can't always afford it. That was a considerable obstacle for me to acquire skills because I can't afford it. If I can't afford it, then I can't use (or learn) their "proprietary" technology.

That is where free open source comes in. Because of that, I was able to be self-taught. It allowed me to learn to program. Also, it allowed me to use Linux distro, which is cheaper than buying any new Windows upgrade. With that, I was able to expand my skills and knowledge.

Because of that, I'm able to use the Internet that helps overcome my obstacle as a Deaf person. Because of Internet technology, I can communicate with anyone by text message or email. By using a search engine, I can search for any resource that would help overcome the obstacle by being Deaf. When I'm on the Internet, my disability disappeared.

So it is vital to keep the Internet open and free. I fear that any single entity having too much control of the Internet would stifle my ability to grow as a person. The Internet allows me to pursue a career, explore my hobby, expand my knowledge and education, reach out to the community without regard to how much money you have in the bank.
