### More about me:

Coding since early teengager when I found an Apple IIc under the Christmas tree. I am completely self­ taught, and coding has opened up a world that once had seemed pretty limited to me. I was born Deaf and learned at an early age how to overcome communication challenges. Coding created an environment where I could creatively express myself, communicate freely, and that being Deaf didn’t matter. In fact, with today’s technology, I communicate more effectively on account of being Deaf. I have to be extra attentive at all times when communicating with customers; therefore I am less likely to miss important details. I can
also bring my experience as a Deaf consumer to the table. I can offer the perspective of a whole community that is often overlooked.
