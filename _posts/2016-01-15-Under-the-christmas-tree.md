### Wow...but not over yet.



The last few weeks of my life has been one wild, crazy, stressful, fun, challenging and enjoyable time for me. It was a time of Wedding, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year. Imagine me trying to manage my time between job, my loved one, FirehoseProject, and community. It wasn't easy but got it balanced. Whew.

My time with FireHoseProject has been so challenging and enjoyable. It fits me because I love to explore and solve. And FirehoseProject give me plently of it.

There has been times where I would stay up all night trying to solve a bug, figuring out how to code this or that, or reading up on installing a gem properly.

I've been doing this since when I was young. When I was around 10 or 11, I got my first computer, Apple IIc, under the Christmas tree from 'Santa'. That early morning I jump right into coding. By the time everyone else woke up, I have completed graphical animated 'trailing bouncing line' using BASIC language on IIc. (similar to image at top of this blog.)

Now I am near completing the Firehouse Project. I'm at home, sitting right next to Christmas Tree working on my personal Ruby on Rails project. Wow. What a sentimental moment.

Now Im looking forward to coding future. Looking forward to what will I find next under the Christmas tree.

Thanks, FirehoseProject for making it happen.
