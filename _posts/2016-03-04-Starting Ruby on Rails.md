### Ruby on Rails is fun

***

Yes. Really. [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), the web application framework, is fun. At least for me.

I have played around with different langauges: BASIC (remember that?), HTML, perl, Java, Visual Basic, C++, etc.

Ruby on Rails has few parts. The front end (what you see on screen) and the back end (the coding, database and all the dirty work). You code everything in Ruby Langauge.

To get you started on Ruby on Rails, there are few things you need to learn. It's not that bad.

Here are few things to learn the basics:

  * [Terminal (the shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29) ([Bash](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/)/[zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)/etc)
  * [GIT](http://www.git-scm.com/)
  * [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
  * [Bundle](http://bundler.io/)
  * [HTML5](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp)
  * [Ruby Language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
  * [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
  * [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  * [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
  * blogs (your choice)
    * [Ghost](https://ghost.org)
    * [Medium](https://medium.com)
    * [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
    * (many, many, more to choose from)

(How to set it up on your computer depends on what platform  you are using: Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows. I might make other post on this topics).

When you see this list, you might think:

 >"Oh boy. That's a lot to learn!"

Don't be intimidated. It may seem that way. If you learn one of those items in the list at a time, get the feel of it, play around with it, your confidences will grow.

But there is one important skills that you really, really need that will help you speed up the learning journey.

> Know how to use Internet to find the answer.

The Internet is the best resource to find the answer. If you are stuck with a problem that you can't figure out, Research it, Google it, use any search engine. Most of their results will point you to [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/) which is where pretty much all coding related answers can be found.

That should give you idea on how to get started.

Once I learned the basics of each item, I started to write several web apps, experiment, and just, basically, had fun doing it.
